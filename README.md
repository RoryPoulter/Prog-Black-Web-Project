## Using the web app
### Uploading Recipes
To add a new recipe, the following inputs are required:
* Drink name
* Drink instructions
* At least 2 ingredients with measurements

Recipes can have up to 15 ingredients and each must be listed with an amount. The amount of ingredients can be changed by clicking the `+`/`-` buttons.

An image can be uploaded but is not required; if no image is uploaded, the image below is displayed with the drink instead:

![placeholder image](https://placehold.co/200x200?text=No+Image)

When all inputs have been entered, press the `Share` button.

If the drink name is not unique, or there are missing required inputs, the recipe will not be posted.

### Searching Recipes
Recipes can be filtered based on if they contain a given ingredient and if the have at most a certain amount of ingredients. To show all recipes, the `ingredient` selection field should be left as `-------` (this does not filter by ingredients), move the slider to the right and click `Search`.

The order of results can be toggled to be either oldest to newest or vice versa.

If no recipes match the search criteria, the search results will not change.


### Deleting Recipes
Recipes can be deleted from the API. This can be done by entering the drink name into the form and clicking the `Submit` button. The input is not case sensitive.
